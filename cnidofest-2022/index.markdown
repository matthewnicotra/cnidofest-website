## Scope

We welcome abstracts from any scientist using a cnidarian as a model organism to understand the molecular basis of fundamental biological processes. **We strongly encourage trainees to submit abstracts for oral presentations**. For Cnidofest 2022, there will be an emphasis on sharing tools that facilitate this kind of research in cnidarians. Sessions will be organized according to the following themes: 

* Neurobiology
* Development
* Evolution
* Genomics
* Immunology
* Symbiosis
* Ecology (with a molecular focus)
* Physiology
