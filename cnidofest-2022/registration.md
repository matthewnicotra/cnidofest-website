## Registration is now open for Cnidofest 2022. 

The registration fees will be $525.00 for PIs and $250 for trainees and staff. This fee will include all meals during the conference. 


### Registration will close <span style= "color:red">August 15, 2022</span>

Please register early. Due to space limitations, there will be a cap of 150 attendees, and interest has exceeded our capacity.

### If you are a PI:
Register yourself at the official registration page: <a href="https://ces-apps.ucdavis.edu/confreg/?confid=1201" target="_blank">Cnidofest 2022 Registration (links to UC Davis)</a> 

### If you are a trainee or staff member:
Fill out the <a href="https://forms.gle/zmwcf14WT3xJ9Q5G9" target="_blank"> Trainee/Staff Registration Form (links to Google Form)</a>. This is not an official registration but will guarantee you have a spot at Cnidofest. This is also non-binding.

**At this time, we are not asking trainees and staff to register officially for the meeting.** This is because we anticipate being able to reduce the registration fee for most trainees and staff. However, this is contingent on our NSF grant being funded. We will contact the trainees and staff listed in this form with further instructions once we know the results of the grant application.
