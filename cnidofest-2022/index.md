## About Cnidofest

### Scope

We welcome abstracts from any scientist using a cnidarian as a model organism to understand the molecular basis of fundamental biological processes. **We strongly encourage trainees to submit abstracts for oral presentations**. For Cnidofest 2022, there will be an emphasis on sharing tools that facilitate this kind of research in cnidarians. Sessions will be organized according to the following themes: 

* Neurobiology
* Development
* Evolution
* Genomics
* Immunology
* Symbiosis
* Ecology (with a molecular focus)
* Physiology

## Logistics


### Lodging

> Please note: There are several errors on the "Accommodations" page on the UC Davis registration website.

Our suggestion is to book Hyatt Place using the link below, which will not expire. This hotel is by far the closest to the conference site, but it is also further from the downtown area (i.e. restaurants and bars).

Here are the instructions and the link for Hyatt Place:

1. Click [this link](https://www.hyatt.com/en-US/hotel/california/hyatt-place-uc-davis/smfzu?corp_id=01836) to go to the Hyatt website. Using the link is important because your discount is built into the URL.
2. Click on the “Book Now” button, enter your arrival and departure dates, and click the “Book Now” button again. Here is where you will see room options for the UC Davis Discount.
3. Select your room type and proceed with the booking.

Alternatively, directly calling other hotels is more likely to be productive than using the links on the website.

- [Hilton Garden Inn](https://www.hilton.com/en/hotels/smfdagi-hilton-garden-inn-davis-downtown/){:target="_blank"}: (530) 753-3600
- University Park Inn and Suites: (530) 756-0910  
- [Aggie Inn](https://www.choicehotels.com/california/davis/ascend-hotels/cad04): (530) 756-0352  
- [Palm Court](https://www.bestwestern.com/en_US/book/davis/hotel-rooms/best-western-plus-palm-court-hotel/propertyCode.05536.html):  (530) 753-7100   

Finally, please feel free to search for alternative options in the city of Davis. It is a small city, and anything in the downtown area will likely be close enough. For your information, the conference will be held in the Alumni Center, which is [here](https://goo.gl/maps/rx375kAMVeQfyW9y7){:target="_blank"}

It would be difficult for us to answer too many direct questions about booking hotels, but please do email if you have a pressing issue.



### Traveling to Davis

UC Davis is located near two international airports - [Sacramento International (SMF)](http://www.sacramento.aero/smf/) and [San Francisco International (SFO)](http://www.flysfo.com/). Depending on where you are coming from, you will likely fly into one of these airports and then take ground transportation to Davis or Sacramento. There are a number of transportation options from each airport depending on how much money and time you wish to spend, including the Davis Airporter, Lyft, and Uber, or other rideshares and public transit like Yolobus or Amtrak.

**When choosing flights, please keep in mind your arrival time, as SMF is typically a 25-45 minute trip to Davis and SFO can take between 2-3 hours depending on the time of day.** 

**From SMF to Davis**

The Sacramento International Airport (SMF) is just over 20 miles (32 km) from UC Davis which can take between 25 minutes to an hour, depending on the time of day and traffic. It is advisable to use a map application (like Waze, Google Maps, Apple Maps, etc,) to estimate travel time when deciding upon transportation options. **If you are headed to a location in Sacramento from SMF, the distance is shorter so taxi and ride sharing services will be less expensive; YoloBus will cost approximately the same amount.** 

- **Davis Airporter** is a private airport shuttle service used by many residents of Davis. This is a door-to-door service that must be arranged in advance for one or more persons. All reservations must be made at least three days in advance. For more information, [visit their website](https://www.davisairporter.com/).
- **SuperShuttle** is a shuttle service between San Francisco Airport (SFO), Davis and Sacramento Airport (SMF). The shuttle bus will pick you up at the airport and drop you off at your residence in Davis. It is not required to make a reservation beforehand, but it is highly recommended. For more information, [visit their website](http://www.supershuttle.com/locations/sanfranciscosfo).
- **Yolobus** is a public transit system that services Yolo County and the surrounding area. Two Yolobus routes provide hourly transportation between SMF and Davis, and they do not require advance reservations. Students need to know which bus stop is closest to their apartment or house before boarding the bus. Go to the [Yolobus website](http://yolobus.com/routes/index.php/42A) for more information.

**From SFO to Davis**

The San Francisco International Airport (SFO) is just over 80 miles (120 km) from UC Davis which can take between 1 hour and 45 minutes to 2 hours and 30 minutes, depending on the time of day and traffic. It is advisable to use a map application (like Waze, Google Maps, Apple Maps, etc.) to estimate travel time when deciding upon transportation options. **If you are headed to a location in Sacramento from SFO, the distance is farther so Amtrak, taxi and ride sharing services will be slightly more expensive.** You may also choose to contact SuperShuttle (see abobe) for an airport shuttle option.

### COVID-19 Policies

We are happy to be welcoming an international group of scientists on the UC Davis campus. It is our goal to keep our participants as safe as possible and to hopefully avoid anybody becoming unable to return home due to a Covid-19 outbreak. Therefore, we kindly ask that you adhere to the following rules while at the event:

- Masks will be <u>required</u> at all indoor functions, which includes the oral sessions and poster session. Masks will be provided at the event.

- We have planned meals to enable people to eat and drink outside in the beautiful California sunshine as much as possible. Coffee breaks and breakfast will be served inside, but conference goers will be encouraged to take their food and drinks outdoors. Boxed lunches will be provided so that you may carry them to eat outside. Dinner will be buffet-style, with food tables set up inside but seating outside.  

- As per UC Davis policy, you should be prepared to show proof of vaccination or a negative COVID test when you check-in at the event if we ask for it. We will accept any vaccination proof that is typical for your country of origin. A digital image of the vaccination proof is acceptable. We will have a limited number of antigen tests on hand. If you have any questions about this requirement, please contact Matt (matthew.nicotra@pitt.edu) or Celina (cejuliano@ucdavis.edu). 

Finally, if you will require a negative Covid test to return to your home country, please email Celina (cejuliano@ucdavis.edu). We will arrange transportation and make appointments, if you contact her by September 1.
