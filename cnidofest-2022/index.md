## About the meeting

### Scope

We welcome abstracts from any scientist using a cnidarian as a model organism to understand the molecular basis of fundamental biological processes. **We strongly encourage trainees to submit abstracts for oral presentations**. For Cnidofest 2022, there will be an emphasis on sharing tools that facilitate this kind of research in cnidarians. Sessions will be organized according to the following themes: 

* Neurobiology
* Development
* Evolution
* Genomics
* Immunology
* Symbiosis
* Ecology (with a molecular focus)
* Physiology

## Logistics


### Lodging

We have reserved rooms at several hotels close to the UC Davis campus. Further information about these accomodations can be found on the <a href="https://ces-apps.ucdavis.edu/confreg/index.cfm?confid=1201&webid=5869." target="_blank">official registration page</a>.

### Traveling to Davis

UC Davis is located near two international airports - [Sacramento International (SMF)](http://www.sacramento.aero/smf/) and [San Francisco International (SFO)](http://www.flysfo.com/). Depending on where you are coming from, you will likely fly into one of these airports and then take ground transportation to Davis or Sacramento. There are a number of transportation options from each airport depending on how much money and time you wish to spend, including the Davis Airporter, Lyft, and Uber, or other rideshares and public transit like Yolobus or Amtrak.

**When choosing flights, please keep in mind your arrival time, as SMF is typically a 25-45 minute trip to Davis and SFO can take between 2-3 hours depending on the time of day.** 

**From SMF to Davis**

The Sacramento International Airport (SMF) is just over 20 miles (32 km) from UC Davis which can take between 25 minutes to an hour, depending on the time of day and traffic. It is advisable to use a map application (like Waze, Google Maps, Apple Maps, etc,) to estimate travel time when deciding upon transportation options. **If you are headed to a location in Sacramento from SMF, the distance is shorter so taxi and ride sharing services will be less expensive; YoloBus will cost approximately the same amount.** 

- **Davis Airporter** is a private airport shuttle service used by many residents of Davis. This is a door-to-door service that must be arranged in advance for one or more persons. All reservations must be made at least three days in advance. For more information, [visit their website](https://www.davisairporter.com/).
- **SuperShuttle** is a shuttle service between San Francisco Airport (SFO), Davis and Sacramento Airport (SMF). The shuttle bus will pick you up at the airport and drop you off at your residence in Davis. It is not required to make a reservation beforehand, but it is highly recommended. For more information, [visit their website](http://www.supershuttle.com/locations/sanfranciscosfo).
- **Yolobus** is a public transit system that services Yolo County and the surrounding area. Two Yolobus routes provide hourly transportation between SMF and Davis, and they do not require advance reservations. Students need to know which bus stop is closest to their apartment or house before boarding the bus. Go to the [Yolobus website](http://yolobus.com/routes/index.php/42A) for more information.

**From SFO to Davis**

The San Francisco International Airport (SFO) is just over 80 miles (120 km) from UC Davis which can take between 1 hour and 45 minutes to 2 hours and 30 minutes, depending on the time of day and traffic. It is advisable to use a map application (like Waze, Google Maps, Apple Maps, etc.) to estimate travel time when deciding upon transportation options. **If you are headed to a location in Sacramento from SFO, the distance is farther so Amtrak, taxi and ride sharing services will be slightly more expensive.** You may also choose to contact SuperShuttle (see abobe) for an airport shuttle option.
